# 40 Days of Agentic AI Challenge  🚀  
**MLSAUOK – 2026**

## About This Repository 📌
This repository is part of my journey in the **40 Days of Agentic AI Learning Challenge** organized under **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors University of Karachi (MLSAUOK)**.

It is a central space where I document everything I do over the next 40 days  from small experiments to mini-projects while keeping a structured record of my learning.


## My Goals 🎯
During this challenge, I aim to:

- Build a strong understanding of **Agentic AI**  
- Learn how AI-driven systems operate and make decisions  
- Apply concepts through **hands-on mini-projects**  
- Experiment with modern tools and APIs  
- Improve problem-solving skills using AI  
- Maintain consistency and discipline in daily learning


## What You’ll Find Here 🛠️
This repository includes:

- **Day-wise folders** documenting daily work (`day-01` to `day-40`)  
- **Mini-projects and code experiments** built during the challenge  
- **Reflections and observations** recorded after each hands-on session  

Everything is structured to make my learning **clear traceable and easy to review**.


## How the Repository Is Organized 📂
```

/day-01
/day-02

/day-40
/projects

```
> Each `day-XX` folder contains the work and documentation completed on that day.

## Mentorship 🤝
This challenge is being done under the guidance of **Muzammil Jethwa** a senior AI engineer


##  Why I’m Doing This Challenge 🔥

I joined this challenge to **learn by doing** not just by watching tutorials. 

The goal is to **build things see how AI works in practice and document the journey** as I go.
